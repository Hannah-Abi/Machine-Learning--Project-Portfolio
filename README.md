## Machine-Learning--Project-Portfolio

I used to dream of becoming a Machine Learning engineer, employing various algorithms to tackle diverse real-world business challenges. Ever since I delved into machine learning and deep learning, I started noticing algorithms almost everywhere I go, which is quite amusing :D. In the realm of Machine Learning and AI, there's no real entry-level; it's an ongoing learning process to enhance algorithms or explore different ones for optimal results. Occasionally, achieving the best outcome is challenging, especially when dealing with data that may not be easily trainable in any ML model due to its nature.
